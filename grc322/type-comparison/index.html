        <h1 class="dark_ice">Sutro vs. Clarendon </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Clarendon</h3>
            
             <p>Originating in London, England, Clarendon was invented by Thorowgood and Besley, commonly known as the Fann Street Foundry in 1845. It is a distinctive serif font that is widely recognized for its bold, slab-like serifs and strong vertical lines. Originally designed for use in advertising and posters, Clarendon has since become popular for use in headings and titles, particularly in print media. Its bold, attention-grabbing style makes it well-suited for large headlines, while its legibility at smaller sizes has also made it a popular choice for body text. Clarendon is a classic typeface that has remained popular for over a century and continues to be used today in a wide range of applications. Clarendon is now also used to refer to slab-serif fonts inspired by that era, denoted most commonly by the thick and thin bold slab-serifs. Today, variants can be found in many places from US national park typefaces to antique trains.</p>
             
			 <h3>Sutro</h3>

             <p>Designed by Jim Parkinson of Parkinson Design, the idea for the type started in the 60’s when Jim was attending the Kansas City Art Institute where he met a type teacher Rob Roy Kelly who was writing a book on American wood type. This inspiration remained strong in Parkinson’s following work, in magazines and the like (including a slab serif logo for newsweek). Finally in 2003, the font family came to life in the culmination of that work and taking inspiration from the Nebiolo Egiziano typeface, Sutro was born. Sutro is a modern typeface and features sharp angles, squared-off curves, and a distinct contrast between thick and thin strokes, giving it a unique and eye-catching look. The font has a strong and authoritative presence, making it well-suited for headlines, branding, and advertising.</p>

			    
			<h2>Comparison</h2>
            <p>Sutro and Clarendon are two distinct typefaces with different design characteristics. Sutro is a modern font that takes inspiration from the Art Deco movement, featuring sharp angles and a strong contrast between thick and thin strokes. In contrast, Clarendon is a classic serif font with bold, slab-like serifs and strong vertical lines. Clarendon font appears to have a greater extended width compared to Sutro. In addition, the tracking between each letter differs between the two typefaces. Each letter in Clarendon generally has more weight than the letters in Sutro. While both fonts are suitable for use in headlines and titles, they have different styles and personalities. Sutro has a more modern and edgy feel, while Clarendon has a more traditional and timeless look.</p>
