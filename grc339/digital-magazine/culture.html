                                <p> <em>Arc De Soleil</em> is one of the many monikers of composer, producer and
                                multi-instrumentalist Daniel Kadawatha. With a focus on strong
                                melodies and stringed instruments like the guitar and sitar, as well as
                                infectious grooves and beats, Arc De Soleil's music is both nostalgic
                                and fresh.
