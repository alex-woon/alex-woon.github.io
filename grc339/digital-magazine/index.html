                                    Nestled in the heart of Half Moon Bay, a small coffee shop is making big waves with its unique blend of locally sourced beans and artisanal pastries. Step inside and discover the hidden gem that has locals buzzing.

                                    Located at the tip of the Balboa Peninsula, this infamous break is where the waves get squeezed into a narrow gap between the rock jetty and the beach, causing them to rebound and collide, creating a powerful wedge-shaped wave. "The Wedge" is Newport's spot to surf and the locals have something to say.

                                <p> <em>Arc De Soleil</em> is one of the many monikers of composer, producer and
                                multi-instrumentalist Daniel Kadawatha. With a focus on strong
                                melodies and stringed instruments like the guitar and sitar, as well as
                                infectious grooves and beats, Arc De Soleil's music is both nostalgic
                                and fresh.
